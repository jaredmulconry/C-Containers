C-Containers
============

This will be the place where my experimentation with C++ containers will take place. 
My goal is to target C++11 where possible, where the minimum conformance requirement
for compilers will be the feature-set supported by Visual C++ 14, shipped with Visual 
Studio 2015. As the requirements change, this read-me will be updated with the relevant
information.
